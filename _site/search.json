    "text": "For this first lab, we analyze the changes of population for different Chicago neighborhoods between the years 2010 and 2020. We see that neighborhoods such as the Near North Side, the Near West Side, and Hyde Park grew overall in population. Others, such as Roseland and South Chicago actually shrank in population over the same period of time.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphical representation of percent change in population based on data from ReferencesCCAProfiles20162020 file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Kling et al.) is my first source, and it is from an article in a scholarly journal. My second source, (Rohde), is from a website that I did not find to be very helpful. The book source that I just to sample here to practice references is (Voelker), and it was one of the most recent texts that I could find from a quick Google search.\niv) Produce a table that lists the names and percentage population change for those community areas with an increase in population of more than 10 percent.\nv) Produce a table that lists the names and percentage population change for those community areas with an decrease in population of more than 10 percent.\n\nIn this Quarto Markdown document, use your visualization and two tables to write a short summary of population change for Chicago Community Areas."

    "text": "Highlight one or two things you are especially proud of regarding your submission. This could be a particular element within the assignment or could be part of your process (e.g. time management, applying new techniques, etc.).\n\nI am proud of being able to overcome the learning curve that I was already anticipating with diving back into R for the semester. It’s been some years since I’ve used the program, and even then it was only to a fairly entry-level extent. So being able to complete the tasks of this lab was something I was proud of.\n\nIf you were to start this assignment over again, what are one or two things that you might do differently?\n\nI would definitely ask for help sooner. For the most part, I spent a long period of time trying to figure out why my code wasn’t working. I was watching YouTube videos and scrolling through forums looking for answers, but using Slack or sending a quick email to Prof Greenlee was much more effective and timely.\n\nAre there any aspects or areas in your submission where you would like us to focus our feedback?\n\nI would like to get some feedback specifically about redundancies or unnecessary aspects in both my code and my directory set up. I want to know if there were things that I did that made things harder for myself or just additional work, or if I can streamline my process in any way.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, please rate how ready you feel this work is for sharing with a public audience (where 1 is not at all ready to be shared and 10 is polished and ready for public dissemination). Briefly describe why you gave your work this rating.\n\nI would give myself a 7. Compared to when I gave my first pass on this initial lab, my rating would have been somewhere around a 2, because I wasn’t able to complete multiple steps to the Lab because of issues with my setup or code. Now that I was able to fully work my way through those problems, I think I’m more comfortable sharing my work.\nThank you for taking the time to evaluate your efforts. We look forward to sharing feedback with you soon!"
