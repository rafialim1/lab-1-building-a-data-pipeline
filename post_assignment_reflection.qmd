## Reflection Prompts

1.  Highlight one or two things you are especially proud of regarding your submission. This could be a particular element within the assignment or could be part of your process (e.g. time management, applying new techniques, etc.).

2.  If you were to start this assignment over again, what are one or two things that you might do differently?

3.  Are there any aspects or areas in your submission where you would like us to focus our feedback?

4.  On a scale of 1 to 10, please rate how ready you feel this work is for sharing with a public audience (where 1 is not at all ready to be shared and 10 is polished and ready for public dissemination). Briefly describe why you gave your work this rating.

Thank you for taking the time to evaluate your efforts. We look forward to sharing feedback with you soon!
